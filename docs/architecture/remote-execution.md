# Remote Execution

Ginkgo supports dispatching individual tasks to cloud infrastructure while the
rest of the workflow runs locally. Remote dispatch is opt-in at the task level:
tasks with `gpu > 0` or `remote=True` are sent to the configured executor;
everything else stays local.

## Remote Executor Protocol

The evaluator dispatches remote work through a `RemoteExecutor` protocol
(`runtime/remote_executor.py`). The protocol defines:

- `RemoteExecutor.submit(attempt=...)` → `RemoteJobHandle`
- `RemoteJobHandle.state()` → `RemoteJobState` (PENDING / RUNNING / SUCCEEDED / FAILED / CANCELLED)
- `RemoteJobHandle.result()` → `RemoteJobResult` (blocking wait + result)
- `RemoteJobHandle.cancel()` / `RemoteJobHandle.logs_tail()`

This keeps executor implementations fully decoupled from the scheduling loop.
The evaluator polls handles on dedicated watcher threads and processes results
through the same code path as local worker completions.

## Executor Implementations

**KubernetesExecutor** (`remote/kubernetes.py`) submits `batch/v1` Jobs to any
Kubernetes cluster. Resource declarations on `@task` map to pod resource
requests: `threads` → CPU, `memory` → memory, `gpu` → `nvidia.com/gpu`. GPU
tasks receive a `cloud.google.com/gke-accelerator` node selector when
`gpu_type` is configured, enabling automatic GPU node provisioning on GKE
Autopilot.

**GCPBatchExecutor** (`remote/gcp_batch.py`) submits jobs to GCP Batch, a
serverless batch compute service. No cluster required — each job runs on
Google-managed infrastructure. GPU tasks use the Batch accelerator allocation
policy. Job logs are retrieved from Cloud Logging.

## Remote Worker

The worker entry point (`remote/worker.py`) runs as
`python -m ginkgo.remote.worker` inside the container. It:

1. Reads the task payload from `GINKGO_WORKER_PAYLOAD` (base64-encoded JSON)
2. Optionally downloads and extracts a code bundle (code-sync mode)
3. Calls the standard `run_task()` worker function
4. Prints a JSON result line to stdout for the handle to parse

The same worker image serves both K8s and GCP Batch executors.

## Code Sync

Two modes for making workflow code available to remote workers:

- **Baked** (default): the worker image already contains the code.
- **Sync**: the evaluator creates a tarball of the workflow package, uploads
  it to cloud storage (content-addressed by SHA-256), and includes the bundle
  coordinates in the task payload. Workers download and extract the bundle
  before importing task functions.

Code sync is configured via `[remote.k8s.code]` or `[remote.batch.code]`
with `mode = "sync"` and `package = "<dir>"`. The bundle is published to the
remote artifact backend configured in `[remote.artifacts]`.

## Remote Provenance and Events

Remote execution integrates fully with the existing provenance and event
systems:

- `TaskStarted` events carry `execution_backend` ("local" / "remote") and
  are rendered as `↑ submitted` in the CLI for remote tasks.
- `TaskRunning` events are emitted when a remote pod transitions from PENDING
  to RUNNING, updating the CLI to `◐ running`.
- `TaskCompleted` and `TaskFailed` events carry `remote_job_id`.
- Provenance records include `execution_backend`, `remote_job_id`, and
  `resources` for remote tasks.
- `ginkgo inspect run` surfaces all remote metadata.
- Pod/container logs are captured at task completion via `handle.logs_tail()`.

## GCS Backend

`GCSFileSystemBackend` (`remote/fsspec_backends.py`) extends the fsspec base
class with Google Cloud Storage support via `gcsfs`. It supports
`head()`, `download()`, `upload()`, and `list_prefix()` operations and is
used for both remote input staging and code bundle publishing.

## Infrastructure Scripts

- `scripts/gke-setup.sh` — creates a GKE Autopilot cluster, Artifact Registry,
  IAM bindings, K8s namespace, and builds/pushes the worker image.
- `scripts/gke-teardown.sh` — deletes the cluster and registry.
