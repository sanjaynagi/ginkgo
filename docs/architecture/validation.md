# Validation Workflows

The current implementation is validated against the canonical workflow families below:

- `VW-1` linear dependency chains
- `VW-2` fan-out / fan-in
- `VW-3` conditional branching
- `VW-4` mixed fan-out with conditional branches
- `VW-5` selective cache invalidation
- `VW-6` partial failure and resume
- `VW-7` core-aware resource contention
- `VW-8` memory-aware scheduling

These are exercised through the test suite and, from the CLI layer onward, through `ginkgo run` and `ginkgo test`.

The repository-level validation corpus includes:

- `retail` for static fan-out, fan-in, and shell-generated delivery
  bundles, now including a notebook-backed reporting step
- `news` for runtime-determined `ExprList` expansion and dynamic dependency
  recording
- `supplychain` for multi-scenario analysis with richer artifact fan-in
- `chem` for chemistry-domain portfolio review with
  runtime-determined per-series packet generation
- `ml` for ML-domain candidate evaluation, promotion, and delivery
  packaging across a deeper static DAG

The foundational `bioinfo` example also demonstrates mixed execution
environments: Pixi-based shell tasks for bioinformatics tools, a Docker
container shell task for basic Unix processing, and local Python tasks
for data aggregation.

`tests/test_examples.py` runs these examples end to end in isolated workspaces
and asserts expected artifacts, manifests, dynamic dependency behavior, and
cache reuse on rerun.
