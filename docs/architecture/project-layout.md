# Canonical Workflow Project Layout

Ginkgo treats the following repository structure as the canonical default for
workflow projects:

```text
<project-root>/
├── pixi.toml
├── ginkgo.toml
├── <project_package>/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── workflow.py   # contains flow definition
│   ├── modules/      # contains tasks, grouped in modules
│   └── envs/
├── tests/
│   └── workflows/
├── results/          # runtime-created, optional
└── .ginkgo/          # runtime-created, optional
```

Within that layout:

- `<project_package>/workflow.py` is the canonical CLI entrypoint and should
  remain thin, containing flow definitions and graph wiring only.
- Reusable task implementations live under `<project_package>/modules/`.
- Task-specific Pixi manifests may live under `<project_package>/envs/`.
- `tests/workflows/` holds workflow validation files for `ginkgo test`.

The CLI auto-discovers the canonical `<project_package>/workflow.py` when
`ginkgo run` is invoked from the repository root without an explicit workflow
argument. Legacy root-level `workflow.py` files and explicit workflow paths
remain supported for non-canonical project layouts.
